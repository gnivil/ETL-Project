# ETL-Project

Project Proposal - ETL 

We will be comparing hospital data to income data. We will be getting data from Kaggle, links below:
https://www.kaggle.com/carlosaguayo/usa-hospitals
https://www.kaggle.com/goldenoakresearch/us-household-income-stats-geo-locations?select=kaggle_income.csv

The data will be saved in .csv files and extracted from there. 
Significant transformations will be done to get the tables we want. 
We plan to aggregate Zip codes and create or tables based on that.
Data will be stored on SQL through postgres.
